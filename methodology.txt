Need a methodology for how we add new frames and functionality
- Decide on a grammatical phrase that needs to be added
- its either A) a brand new TYPE of phrase, or B) a new phrase that is an instance of an existing type

A) brand new TYPE 
- Needs a new grammar generator

B) New phrase 
- Create the frame 
- Create the nodes
- Add it to the appropriate grammar generator

Functionality to add
- domain model updates
- adding triggers (conditionals)

Suppose we want to add a conditional 
- example: The seller must submit the invoice
- e.g. if the contract is terminated, the seller must submit the invoice 

structure:
- IF + NOUN PHRASE 

This is going to be a completely different grammar tree 
- the GrammarGenerator that I've defined is actually only one of potentially many 
- that one corresponds to time-based prepositional phrases 
- but maybe we need a separate one for conditionals 

[CONDITION] the seller must submit the invoice 

FRAME: [IF] [STATE]

=> IF [state]
state: subject, event 

Construction of it:
- IF
-- state: subject and event

examples
- contract has been terminated
- the delivery obligation has been fulfilled
