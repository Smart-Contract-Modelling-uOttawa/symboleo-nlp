biomass_contents: Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total THC content.
- maybe a precondition?

contaminants: The Biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing Biomass including but not limited to: Mold and Mildew; Non-Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria.
- maybe another precondition

pricing: Both Parties mutually agree that the Purchase Price of the Product is determined on a $5.00 per pound basis for a total cost of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).
- Just declarative info

lab_testing: Both Parties agree that CBD potency numbers are determined by a third-party lab according to standard testing protocol which was provided by the seller.
- there is a bit of an "implied" obligation that the seller must provide a testing protocol 

buyer_testing: Buyer may take their own samples ("Product Samples") for testing as well.
- This is just a permission. Not tracked by Symboleo 

payment: Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment [upon execution of this agreement].
- Some redundancies in here: "Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that "
-- does that contain any valuable information?
- Can have a antecedent about contract activation - again though, seems kinda redundant
- Refinement: If contract activation - antecedent - should add upon (upon contract activation)


quarantine: Once the payment has been received, Shi Farms will use its best efforts to quarantine product to ensure safe keeping of the Product until delivery date as agreed by the Parties.
- Antecedent: payment received - may want to add "once", but not necessary 
-- If payment is completed (ob fulfilled)
- quarantine is a situation - needs to be framed as an event - not released from quarantine 
- until delivery date - could identify a timepoint, or use delivery event 
-- this is a case where they would want to specify an existing event - can use ob fulfilled though 

delivery_location: The point of delivery of the Product Samples shall be a laboratory determined by Gridiron, if Gridiron determines that third party analysis of the Biomass is required for processing.
- this is saying: if gridiron determines that third party testing is required THEN deliver to a lab 
-- complicated one - subordinator "that"
-- wont be able to handle this one. Can still show it though

shipping: Shi Farms shall be responsible to ship the Product Samples to the designated laboratory.
- this follows from the previous statement. Just saying that Shi farms has to deliver it 
- this is a legit obligation. But its only activated if the determination is made 
-- could potentially recombine these two

delivery: Shi Farms shall be responsible for delivery of the Biomass to the processor determined by Gridiron, in good form as described above "A. Product".
- this would be in the case where delivery is to be made directly to a processor
-- essentially the default case 
- no refinement required  

termination: Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to delivery of the Product
- "prior to" used with a power - this results in a trigger to suspend a power 
-- interesting one. Can I support it?
- There may be more discussion on how these refinements affect obs vs powers 
- PFPower not implemented in Symboleo... maybe we skip this one then?
-- OR I could just add it in on my own. Its commented out in the code 

legal_proceedings: If any claim or legal proceeding is filed by a third party, prompt notice is required by the one to the other.
- there is an antecedent here, but there is coreference involved - hard to separate the basic norm away from it 
-- wont handle this one - the semantics dont allow it 
-- can represent it in Symboleo, but its a bit off 

return_disclose_info: When the Agreement ends, each party shall return all copies of any such information to the other and take every reasonable measure to preclude its representatives from sharing or keeping such information.
- This has two clear obligation statements, each of which could be split up to two each (buyer/seller)
- We dont want to change the NL contract - we will just represent one  
- trigger for end of contract 
- return all copies of info - easy one 
- take meassure to prevent info released - this could be a surviving obligation 


NOTES
- not actually a lot I can do with this one... 
- Still provides some good lessons and roadmaps
- Highlights the importance of the isolated tests 

TODO
- add Upon - upon contract activation
- add When - for trigger
