This Agreement shall be effective on the date of signing this Agreement (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Effective Date”) and will end on [END_DATE].

The premises that are to be rented by the Landlord are located at (address) [PROPERTY_ADDRESS].

The premises are to be used only for residential purposes and may be occupied only by the 
registered occupants. 
- prob just ignor this
- could potentially do an event: use for non-residential purposes, then make a not obligation (double negative)

The monthly rent to be paid by the Renter to the Landlord is [MONTHLY_RENT]. It is to be 
paid by the Renter before the first day of every month, such that the first rent payment is due 
on [FIRST_RENT_DUE_DATE].
- Need a frequency....
- There is an adjunct - we can potentially work with it (before the first day of every month)

The method of payment preferred by both parties is [PAYMENT_METHOD].

In the event of late payments made by the Renter, the Landlord is entitled to impose a 
[LATE_FINE] fine as late fee. 
- If violate payment obligation ==> impose a fine; this is similar to the meat sale sample 

Prior to taking occupancy of the premises, the Renter will pay the Landlord an amount of 
[SECURITY_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT] as a security deposit to cover the cost of any damages suffered by the 
premises and cleaning. 
- This is a good HappensBefore scenario; PRIOR TO EVENT, X ==> HappensBefore(X, EVENT)

Such security deposit will be returned to the Renter upon the end of 
this Agreement, provided the premises are left in the same condition as prior to the occupancy.
- Upon the end of the agreement. This is a good antecedent case;
- Could possibly incorporate multiple - same condition - can we frame this as an event?

This Agreement may be terminated in the event that any of the following occurs:
1. Immediately in the event that one of the Parties breaches this Agreement.
2. At any given time by providing written notice to the other party [TERMINATION_NOTICE_DAYS] days 
prior to terminating the Agreement.
- Immediately [CONDITION] - good one 
- At any given time [CONDITION] ... won't be replicated; but same idea. Good example 


In the event that the Renter abandons the premises during the term of this Agreement, the 
Landlord will be entitled to enter the Premises by any means without facing any liability and 
the Landlord may terminate this Agreement.
- another good one. Actually two separate ones here... 
- Should this be framed as a power???

The Landlord is entitled to enter the premises to inspect or repair the premises.
- Is this a power? I dont know if this notion of power exists in symboleo...
- could add a condition in this case 
- Interesting note... there is a bit of an implied condition (if repairs are needed)

Any dispute or difference whatsoever arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall 
be submitted to arbitration/mediation/negotiation (circle one) in accordance with, and subject 
to the laws of [GOVERNING_LAW_REGION].
- prob ignore this one 

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
[GOVERNING_LAW_REGION].

The Parties agree that the Renter will not keep any pets on the premises without obtaining 
written prior consent from the Landlord. 
- without/unless case... could try this one...
- how to frame this one... is this a power?
- O1: renter shall not keep pets
- P1: gets notice -> Power to suspend O1

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be void and unenforceable by a 
court of competent jurisdiction, then the remaining provisions will remain in force in 
accordance with the Parties’ intention.
- prob ignore this one
