fee: The Contractor will charge the Client a flat fee of $100 for the Services (the "Compensation").
- just descriptive. Nothing else needed

invoice: The Client will be invoiced [when the Services are complete].
- Trigger - this could be obligation fulfillment 

invoice_due: Invoices submitted by the Contractor to the Client are due [within 10 days of receipt]
- "receipt" - will change the CNL here (eq?)
- this suggests a recurrence as well 

In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Client [prior to completion of the Services], but where the Services have been partially performed, the Contractor will be entitled to pro rata payment of the Compensation to the date of termination [provided that there has been no breach of contract on the part of the Contractor]
- Lots going on here 
- In the event of termination [prior to completion of services] - antecedent 
- but where the Services have been partially performed - may not need this 
- the Contractor will be entitled to pro rata payment of the Compensation to the date of termination - this is the ob consequent
- provided that there has been no breach of contract on the part of the Contractor - may not be needed - but could be another antecedent 
- Lets add two here: prior to completion, and provided no breach...

reimburse: The Contractor will be reimbursed from time to time for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Contractor in connection with providing the Services
- from time to time... kinda vague. Lets capture it
- but no refinment on this one 

disclose: The Contractor agrees that they will not disclose, divulge, reveal, report or use, for any purpose, any Confidential Information which the Contractor has obtained, except as authorized by the Client or as required by law
- except - functions as unless 
- there are two - lets just pick one 
- unless client authorizes disclosure?? - lets try that 

return_property: Upon the expiry or termination of this Agreement, the Contractor will return to the Client any property, documentation, records, or Confidential Information which is the property of the Client
- straightforward

subcontract: Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Contractor may, at the Contractor\'s absolute discretion, engage a third party sub-contractor to perform some or all of the obligations of the Contractor under this Agreement and the Client will not hire or engage any third parties to assist with the provision of the Services
- two parts: 
-- contract has a power to subcontract 
-- client can not hire another third party 
- May not be any refinement, but we can capture it 

subcontract_pay: the Contractor will pay the sub-contractor for its services and the Compensation will remain payable by the Client to the Contractor.
- prob no refinement again
