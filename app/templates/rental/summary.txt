pay_rent: The monthly rent to be paid by the Renter to the Landlord is $1500. It is to be paid by the Renter before the first day of every month, such that the first rent payment is due on March 1, 2024
- We will ignore this one for now, as Symboleo does not currently support frequencies 
- This raises an important distinction. Three possibilities for refinements
-- ones that can be rep'd in Symboleo that we can handle
-- ones that can be rep'd in Symboleo that we CANT handle 
-- ones that CANT be rep'd in Symboleo. That's this one
- Make this distinction clear in the discussion and evaluation
- We still want to have a PayRent event and an obligation. For now it will be an unconditional single payment 
- no refinement

late_payment: [In the event of late payments made by the Renter,] the Landlord is entitled to impose a $50 fine as late fee
- in our CNL, treat this as: "if renter fails to pay rent" - are these equivalent?
- Adds an antecedent: not Happens(evt_pay_rent) OR Happens(ObligationEvent.Violated, ob_pay_rent) - both are fine

pay_security_deposit: [Prior to taking occupancy of the premises,] the Renter will pay the Landlord an amount of $1000 as a security deposit to cover the cost of any damages suffered by the premises and cleaning.
- Its a 'prior to EVENT', but it comes at the start; that's fine. 
- CNL: prior to renter occupying the property 
- Will need to create a new event/declaration as well 

return_deposit: Such security deposit will be returned to the Renter [upon the end of this Agreement], provided the premises are left in the same condition as prior to the occupancy
- CNL: Upon contract termination (eq?)
- This will be an antecedent
- There is potential for a second one (provided that...) - this is a complex one - we wont address it

no_pets: The Parties agree that the Renter will not keep any pets on the premises [without obtaining written prior consent from the Landlord]
- CNL: unless landlord provides permission for pets... (eq?)
- not obligation + unless EVENT -> power to suspend the obligation 
-- who gets the power? 
- will require creation of new event; can add a "permission" asset though 

terminate_notice: This Agreement may be terminated at any given time by providing written notice to the other party [30 days prior to terminating the Agreement]
- there is potential here to have a templated event, since this occurs a lot. 
- It is difficult, because the act of providing notice creates the new power in advance 
- clearer: - if A provides X days notice AND X days has elapsed since this notice, then A has power to terminate
- May want to discuss this one... Will probably skip it for now 
- there will be TWO obligations - renter and landlord
- Happens(evt_provide_notice) AND DATE_CHECK(curr > evt_provide_notice.end_date) -> P(...)
-- would require some more sophisticated processing
- no refinement. Need to know how this is represented in symboleo... Ignore for now 

terminate_abandon: In the event that the Renter abandons the premises during the term of this Agreement, the Landlord may terminate this Agreement
- Need to capture the abandons property event 
- CNL: if renter abandons the property 
- antecedent
- This raises the question of if we want to eliminate all powers from the template. 
-- Or maybe just termination powers. Since we might get multiples... And they are easy to create.

TODO
- add a prior to EVENT pattern - WHappensBeforeEvent
- app Upon EVENT pattern - antecedent
- bonus: Figure out how to handle termination notice
