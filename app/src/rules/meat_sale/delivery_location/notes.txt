General process
- Perform some validation - location-based prepositional phrase 
- Extract entities: roles, addresses, noun chunks
- The result may be in the roles, so we want to dig into the domain model roles
-- extract any role mentions as well as coreference resolution from the sentence
--


at its warehouse
- we change the domain model. but what are we changing? 
-- can add a delivery location
-- or can add a buyer location 
-- lets just pick one for now. Lets try delivery location

Once the pattern is verified, the next steps may be easier
- since all were doing is changing the domain model, we dont need to find primitives, etc
- may be as easy as just putting the entire text as delivery.location

But we can do a little bit of cleaning
- for example, if its just "at the warehouse", then we want "warehouse"

Examples
- at the warehouse => "warehouse"
- to its warehouse => use coreference resolution
- to the buyer => use buyer's address (if it exists?)
- 

- more specific locations:
-- behind... for more specific prepositions, may want to keep the prep in the final description
-- multi-prep - to the back door of the warehouse... interesting...
- a specific address - may have some entity detection on this: https://medium.com/globant/building-an-address-parser-with-spacy-e3376b7cff






Ideas

""
- empty case - use buyer's address... or maybe just "buyer"
- can have a default set somewhere
- result: "buyer"

"at the warehouse"
- not much to go off - {prep - det - noun}
- drop the "the", and just set warehouse
- we would need to know that the buyer's address is a warehouse
- should still search through all the properties, and maybe do a semantic similarity check... or wordnet check even
- but not enough info
- result: "warehouse"

"at their warehouse"/"at its warehouse"
- coref
- could use coreferee; but may want to do our own - assume it is the creditors
- again, could do similarity check between buyer props and "warehouse"
- result: buyer.address - the possessive "their" takes precedence over the "warehouse" 

"at the buyer's warehouse"
- detect the possessive 
- same as previous, but no coref needed
- result: buyer.address

"at 1234 Bank Street"
- address entity recognition
