at its warehouse
- we change the domain model. but what are we changing? 
-- can add a delivery location
-- or can add a buyer location 
-- lets just pick one for now. Lets try delivery location

Once the pattern is verified, the next steps may be easier
- since all were doing is changing the domain model, we dont need to find primitives, etc
- may be as easy as just putting the entire text as delivery.location

But we can do a little bit of cleaning
- for example, if its just "at the warehouse", then we want "warehouse"

Examples
- at the warehouse => "warehouse"
- to its warehouse => use coreference resolution
- to the buyer => use buyer's address (if it exists?)
- 

- more specific locations:
-- behind... for more specific prepositions, may want to keep the prep in the final description
-- multi-prep - to the back door of the warehouse... interesting...
- a specific address - may have some entity detection on this: https://medium.com/globant/building-an-address-parser-with-spacy-e3376b7cff
