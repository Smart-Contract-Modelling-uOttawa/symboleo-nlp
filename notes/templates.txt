general
- If working with FITB templates, we will add in sample concrete values, so there is no confusion around the parameters.

questions
- are we assuming one obligation per sentence? Not completely...
- do date refinements need to be added to the domain? Or just as parameters?
-- probably parms at the very least

== MEAT SALE ==

If payment is not completed, the Seller may suspend performance of all of its obligations under the agreement until payment is completed.
- We have an antecedent - straightforward enough
- "the Seller may suspend performance of all of its obligations under the agreement until payment is completed"
- normally with "until EVENT", it would be a HappensBeforeEvent predicate. 
- But since it is a power... we need to treat it as a conditional. There is no HappensBeforeEvent with powers
- when the event triggers (payment is completed), the seller must resume obligation.
- this is a quirk of dealing with powers. May not support this for now
- In this sense, it is actually functioning similar to "unless". So maybe it IS possible to include..

For resuming delivery, should it be a HappensWithin that uses an obligation state 
- see t_raw 

For the termination power, we have "unless late delivery exceeds 10 days". 
- This should be a case of a FALSE trigger being flipped to a Happens(). 
- But the Happens is essentially a point function (10 days after delivery date)
- We currently dont support that
- The other option would be to introduce a new event (e.g. delivery exceeds 10 days)
-- also difficult. May need to think on this one some more

XTEXT
- role issue 
- enum values not recognized (e.g. currency meatQuality) - need to use MeatQuality(PRIME)
- how to specify dates
- the START spec for HappensWithin is a new one
- if using the False trigger, how is it represented - may be a new one
