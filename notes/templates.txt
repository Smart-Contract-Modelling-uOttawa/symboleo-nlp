general
- If working with FITB templates, we will add in sample concrete values, so there is no confusion around the parameters.

questions
- are we assuming one obligation per sentence? Not completely...
-- a few exceptions (e.g. both parties...)

- do date refinements need to be added to the domain? Or just as parameters?
-- probably parms at the very least

- Is there a need to distinguish between events and violated obligations. Since a violated obligation is still an event expression


XTEXT
- role issue 
- enum values not recognized (e.g. currency meatQuality) - need to use MeatQuality(PRIME)
- how to specify dates
- the START spec for HappensWithin is a new one
- if using the False trigger, how is it represented - may be a new one
