mgmt agreement between owner and manager

Will probably pare down some of the obs - focus on the interesting ones

Todos
- convert to sym and verify xtext
-- the Role thing will likely still be an issue
-- verify anything else though
- broaden it to get S(T)
- Create T and parms 
- try demo
- try tests 

# TODO: May set it up so that ANY obligation can have a refinement...could be a condition or a refinement
## Would depend on the frame induced by the CNL
## User selects an obligation instead of a parameter. No need for parameters
## Would need something that keeps track of all of it. Actually wouldnt be too hard.
## Might even allow me to get rid of the parameter config...
## This requires the assumption of a 1-1 correspondence between sentences and norms. Not trivial!
