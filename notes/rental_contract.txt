- Role type for event props (may check with Aidin)
- figure out frequency 
- figure out how to add multiple termination conditions
- NLP stuff 

frequency
- use a trigger and event... if date passes
- the rent2own contract has structures that I dont see in the XText spec. may need clarification here
- for now I'll put a dummy placeholder event, and just use a HappensBefore... but this needs to be addressed 

Symboleo spec role
- Getting an xtext error when I want a Role as a type on an event property. Is there a problem with allowing that?
-- I can see it being an issue since it could allow one to assign the same party to multiple roles...

termination
- in some cases, broadening the contract will yield identical broad norms - a common one is the power to terminate the contract 
-- therefore it makes sense to have a workflow in the application that simply allows the user to create a termination power
-- then we can just remove those from the template T 
-- select the termination workflow; then select the party with the power; 
-- then enter the event (trigger/ante) using the same methods as usual
- will need to add this as a separate workflow 
- this is the beginning of creating completely new norms from scratch... not a bad thing?
-- we initially note that we dont want to do this. But this is a new development
- for the raw contract, leave as is. Will deal with it when making the template


Refinements
- LATE_PAYMENT_CONDITION: just need to add a violation obligation on pay_rent
- SECURITY_DEPOSIT_REFINEMENT: Requires a TakeOccupancy event; then its a happensBefore refinement - NLP
- RETURN_DEPOSIT_REFINEMENT: needs an upon contract termination
- PETS_UNLESS_CONDITION: Need a new event - unless consent to keep pets is obtained from the landlord - NLP 
- TERMINATION_CONDITIONS
-- provide written notice - NLP
-- abandons property - NLP
-- breach of agreement (by either party) x2 - NLP 

NLP stuff
- there are some cases where we need to add new events 
- Want to make sure they are valid events... maybe can use framenet for some 
- There are some that could probably be added as "common contract events"
-- provide written notice, breach of agreement 
-- We could build these in, and add a node for selecting these common contract-related events
-- this library could be expanded upon 
- others are more domain-specifics
-- take occupancy, abandon property, getting consent to keep pets 
-- this would require a custom event... This is where framenet comes in 

Example: take occupancy
- Need: BEFORE EVENT 
- EVENT: The renter occupies the property 
- Start with the verb: occupy
-- ensure its a valid verb 
- decide on the arguments: agent, location 
-- prompt the user for them 
-- if an agent, then may enforce a role 
-- would be very hard to enforce that the location is a property. Maybe they can pick from the declarations, or add a new one...

** looks like there is lots to work with in framenet...

Need the verb 
- then need to decide the r
