Next todos:
- I have a PoC on 3/4 operations. Next try the add_dm_prop - should be interesting - consider the NLP stuff...
- Then try adding a HappensWithin - maybe just a simple between dates?
- Then dig deeper into the structure of events
- Will also need to think about how instantiation of the contract will work here... 

First, need to figure out exactly what I want out of the NLP work 
- Then I need to decide how to technically integrate it smoothly with the rest of the application
- I don't want to inject it into every node...
- It will likely need to originate from the Selection object somehow
