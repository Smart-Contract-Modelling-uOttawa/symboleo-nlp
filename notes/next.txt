done
- finished the rental contract
- organized the process around a sequence of operations - much more testable
- split out the NLP stuff
- Separated out the user scripts for the various operations

Next todos (April):
- Make the contract updates into methods on the SymboleoContract object 
- Ensure the NL aligns properly - verb tenses, etc.
- Make sure that the customizations are updating the nl_parameters
- Get tests up to 95% coverage 
- some initial validation on the verb entry 
- clean up demo, better messages, etc.
- Framenet: Should stress-test this a bit more. Might make a wrapper and a bunch of tests around it
- option to simply declare a new event (easy - already handling it - just make it an operation)
- New contract... 
- Try the frames for adding props again - maybe go for generic properties (e.g. with PROP QUALITY)
- clean out old code and organize folders 

May: 
- Another contract - full-stack test 
- tests up to 98%
- Maybe start web UI 
- wrap up any other NLP 
- start with user string and convert to node list

Jun
- Last contract
- Make a web ui
- work on autocomplete

** Im thinking that it would make more sense for the contract operations to be class methods...
- would keep things a bit more organized, and honestly makes more sense 
- they are straightforward mutations...
- add_domain_obj, add_norm, update_norm, add_decl... all very doable. That's what I should do...
-- This can be a job for April. So dont worry about those operation tests for now. They'll be moved
- Would need to move the spec into a folder so that it is properly tested. Need to do this with some other thigns as well...
