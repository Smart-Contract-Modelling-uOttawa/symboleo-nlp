Next todos:
- Dig deep into Wordnet - how will I inject it into the gramar/node system
- Update the templates - probably merge the meat sale and goods sale into one template
- Will also need to think about how instantiation of the contract will work here... 

First, need to figure out exactly what I want out of the NLP work 
- Then I need to decide how to technically integrate it smoothly with the rest of the application
- I don't want to inject it into every node...
- It will likely need to originate from the Selection object somehow
