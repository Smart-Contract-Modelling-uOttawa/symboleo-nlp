- Add standard contract events - done
- When building declarations (declare_input), show possibilities - done 
- Strongly type the domain object types - maybe?
- Ensure the NL aligns properly - verb tenses, etc.
- Bulk up tests 
- Finish up the rental contract - full-stack test: t--> raw
- some initial validation on the verb entry 
- cleaner user experience - better messages, etc. 
- clean up the demo - hide some more of the functionality. Start anticipating a web flow
- Framenet: Should stress-test this a bit more. Might make a wrapper and a bunch of tests around it
- option to simply declare a new event (easy - already handling it - just make it an operation)
