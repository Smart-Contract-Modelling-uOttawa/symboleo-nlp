Time points 

- if the user enters a date, we want to attach it to the existing event
- for example: PartyA must perform event X [before March 30, 2024]

- original:
-- EvtX
-- evt_x: EvtX;
- new
-- EvtX: due_date: Date 
-- evt_x: EvtX with due_date := 'March 30, 2024'

** could even go a step further and make it a parm 

then in the norm: SHappensBefore(evt_x, evt_x.due_date)

TODOS
- in the declaration/domain mapper, can just recreate it and add to domain updater. it will be handled properly
- in the norm updater, use the date ones... 
-- if its a CSP, then were good
-- if its a concrete date... then need a link 
--- BEFORE => before_date, after_date, until_date...

- lets try it out..
