Lots of my NL patterns contain events 
- IF EVENT, UNLESS EVENT, BEFORE EVENT, etc etc 

Let's figure out more precisely what is meant by this
- Might have various sub-patterns of events 

We're already incorporating contract-related events in 
- can start with that as a blueprint 
- e.g. before the contract has been terminated 
- before the delivery obligation is fulfilled 

In general: 
- it concerns actions performed by one of the parties (agent)
- some actions have recipients, usually the opposite party 

Areas of focus:
- Make sure the existing contract/ob/power events work with proper grammar, etc
- Figure out how to incorporate the domain model events and domain props that include dates
- Identify some common presets/templates

At this point I dont know if there will be a major need to heavily use framenet or even wordnet.
- there is enough work to do without making use of these
