== UNTIL DATE == 
- this one might actually be a HappensWithin?
- Let's get rid of this one... It's ambiguous. There are less ambiguous ways to express the same thing
- e.g. the goods must be delivered until DATE - doesnt make sense 

What about a "from DATE until DATE"
- still doesnt really make sense
- Between DATE and DATE makes way more sense - that works well with a HappensWithin 

I think the UNLESS_EVENT pattern is more straightforward as adding the extra norm...

UNTIL_EVENT ==> add the norm 
UNLESS_EVENT ==> add the norm 

Need to make the default_event more dynamic. Should have the ability to carry a few pieces

== DM prop ==
Lets start with the toy example: delivery must be made using a van:
- The Seller shall deliver the Order in one delivery to the Buyer [DELIVERY_REFINEMENT]
- DELIVERY_REFINEMENT = "using a van"
- pattern: USING NOUN
- result: add a property called "method" to the target event

Places to add the NLP
- on the user input - validation
- on the build_frame
- on the to_obj

Do validation on the user input to ensure they enter something legit
- then we may need to adjust the value depending on the frame or object, so we can use further nlp There
- for now, lets try to use wordnet to get some sense of an "instrument"
- would prefer to have it in one place - so we can centralize the NLP functionality - but that may not work out.
