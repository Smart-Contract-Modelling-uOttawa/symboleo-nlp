Ok, so what are the NLP-related goals
- some of the NL patterns will allow for some freeform input, e.g. specifying new events, instruments, etc. 
-- We need to validate if the text entered by the user does in fact correspond to that entity type 

- Some of the patterns may require conjugating the verbs or other syntactic changes
-- This one should be easier

So for now, we want to verify if ome input entered by a user corresponds to an instrument 


What are the entities?
- Event
- instrument
- method
- general property/quality 

* I should find some real examples of these at some point .
- for today, let's just dive deep into wordnet to see what might be possible 

Lets start with an instrument 
- we should also think about the impact this has on the domain model vs declarations, etc...

First, lets find some actual examples 
- "using" INSTRUMENT
- "with" INSTRUMENT 

* There really aren't that many actual cases of this...
- should we be focusing on it? 
- Should probably focus more on events... lets do that

* Need to establish a sense of priorities - EVENTs are ubiquitous, so lets deal with those
