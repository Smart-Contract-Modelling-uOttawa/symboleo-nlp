Process is as follows
- Extract the sentences to get T0 - done
-- didnt include everything. Theres indemnification, governing law, severability, etc. Could include those too
- Manually convert T0 into S(T0) - requires experts - done
-- requires experts
- Create S(T) by broadening any norms.  done
-- Then Remove any corresponding declarations and domain objects that are unused 
-- in this case it was just removing triggers. No refined predicates...
- Create the corresponding T  - done

- Create the test suite 
- run it. Identify problems...


- Identify the operations that are required 
-- technical details...



sell_buy: Shi Farms agrees to sell Product and Gridiron agrees to purchase 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass ("Biomass") from Shi Farms.
- likely just a precondition and some parameters

biomass_contents: Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total THC content.
- precondition. cannabidiol_percent and thc_percent could be properties on the asset

contaminants: The Biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing Biomass including but not limited to: Mold and Mildew; Non-Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria.
- preconditions: Could have asset properties for each of the contaminants

pricing: Both Parties mutually agree that the Purchase Price of the Product is determined on a $5.00 per pound basis for a total cost of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).
- parameters

lab_testing: Both Parties agree that CBD potency numbers are determined by a third-party lab according to standard testing protocol which was provided by the seller.
- First tough one - likely need an obligation in there, or more likely a precondition
- precondition: Happens(evt_provide_testing_protocol)

buyer_testing: Buyer may take their own samples ("Product Samples") for testing as well.
- Just a right - nothing required here

payment: Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment upon execution of this agreement.
- first part is unneeded. Can be simplified to: the Buyer will remit payment upon execution of this agreement
- then we have an obligation: Happens(Activated(self)) -> O(buyer, seller, true, Happens(evt_payment));
- "execution of the agreement" is a bit ambiguous, but seems to mean contract activation


quarantine: Once the payment has been received, Shi Farms will use its best efforts to quarantine product to ensure safe keeping of the Product until delivery date as agreed by the Parties.
- Occurs predicate with an antecedent
- Should the antecedent (payment received) refer to a) fulfilling the obligation or b) the event happening?
- a) O(seller, buyer, Happens(Fulfilled(obligations.payment)), Occurs(quarantine, Interval(evt_payment.date, evt_delivery.date)) )
- b) O(seller, buyer, Happens(evt_payment), Occurs(quarantine, Interval(evt_payment.date, evt_delivery.date)) )


delivery_location: The point of delivery of the Product Samples shall be a laboratory determined by Gridiron, if Gridiron determines that third party analysis of the Biomass is required for processing.
- Happens(evt_determines_analysis) -> O(seller, buyer, true, evt_deliver_to_lab)
- the DeterminesAnalysis event may require a more complex specification in the domain model (e.g. a DomainEvent that has the property of an event declaration)


shipping: Shi Farms shall be responsible to ship the Product Samples to the designated laboratory.
- (related to above)


delivery: Shi Farms shall be responsible for delivery of the Biomass to the processor determined by Gridiron, in good form as described above "A. Product".
- This is a separate delivery obligation that refers to a delivery to the processor, rather than the lab
- O(seller, buyer, t, Happens(evt_deliver_to_processor))

termination: Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to delivery of the Product.
- pow_termination_buyer: Power(buyer, seller, true, PFContract(Terminated(self)));
- pow_termination_seller: Power(seller, buyer, true, PFContract(Terminated(self)));
- pow_suspend_termination_buyer: Happens(evt_delivery) -> Power(seller, buyer, t, PFPower(pow_termination_buyer, Cancelled))
- pow_suspend_termination_seller: Happens(evt_delivery) -> Power(buyer, seller, t, PFPower(pow_termination_seller, Cancelled))
- * once again, should the trigger be the "delivery event" happening, or the "delivery obligation" being fulfilled? 


legal_proceeding: If any claim or legal proceeding is filed by a third party, prompt notice is required by the one to the other.
- ob_legal_proceeding_seller: Happens(evt_legal_claim_seller) -> O(third_party, seller, true, Happens(evt_legal_notice_seller));
- ob_legal_proceeding_buyer: Happens(evt_legal_claim_buyer) -> O(third_party, buyer, true, Happens(evt_legal_notice_buyer));
- * The triggers could likely be antecedents instead


return_info: When the Agreement ends, each party shall return all copies of any such information to the other and take every reasonable measure to preclude its representatives from sharing or keeping such information.
- ob_return_info_seller: Happens(Terminated(self)) -> O(seller, buyer, true, Happens(evt_return_info_seller))
- ob_return_info_buyer: Happens(Terminated(self)) -> O(buyer, seller, true, Happens(evt_return_info_buyer))
- so_disclose_info_buyer: Happens(Terminated(self)) -> SO(buyer, seller, true, not Happens(evt_disclose_info_buyer))
- so_disclose_info_seller: Happens(Terminated(self)) -> SO(seller, buyer, true, not Happens(evt_disclose_info_seller))







This is a sales agreement for hemp biomass
- its fairly short, has some measurables (smart-contract like)
- but its not a template, and there are lots of nuances in how it might be processed. 

Starts with some basic declarations - laying out parties, payments, etc
-- Shi Farms agrees to sell Product and Gridiron agrees to purchase 30,000 lbs. of hemp biomass ("Biomass") from Shi Farms.
-- Both Parties mutually agree that the Purchase Price of the Product is determined on a $5.00 per pound basis for a total cost of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000)
-- Both Parties agree that CBD potency numbers are determined by a third-party lab according to standard testing protocol which was provided by the seller

These are straightforward enough. No corresponding norms - perhaps some pre/postconditions
- Third party lab might be a role...
- there are implied events as well - e.g. seller must provide standard testing protocol - do we capture that?

Then there are a few variable checks
-- Biomass must contain a minimum of six percent (6%) total Cannabidiol (CBD/and or CBDA) and all Biomass must have less than three percent (3%) total THC content
-- The Biomass must contain no contaminates that are above acceptable industry standards for processing Biomass including but not limited to: Mold and Mildew; Non-Hemp Plant Material; Soil; Insects; Rodent Droppings; Wet or Rotting Material; Heavy Metals; Residual Pesticides or Herbicides; Bacteria

- These are generally supported in Symboleo, but not sure how they are supported in the XText..
- Would these be preconditions? Equality operators
-- e.g. biomass.cannabidiol_percent >= 6...?

NORMS:

Buyer may take their own samples ("Product Samples") for testing as well
- This may be moot. No need to specify anything

Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that the Buyer will remit payment upon execution of this agreement
- first part feels unnecessary: "Both Parties agree that once the Parties have agreed to transaction which includes the purchase and sale of the Product that"
- upon execution of this agreement - trigger = contract activates
- Otherwise its a standard payment event - requires DomainEvent and declaration 

Once the payment has been received, Shi Farms will use its best efforts to quarantine product to ensure safe keeping of the Product until delivery date as agreed by the Parties
- trigger: payment received
- quarantine: is this an event or a situation
- until delivery date - would this be a trigger for a suspension of the quarantine obligation?
- i dont think its a happens within - it may be an occurs??
-- Occurs(quarantine, interval(a, delivery_date))
-- perhaps the interval in a situation is optional? Or defaults to lower/upper bounds (start/end of contract)
-- then this operation refines those... so the operation is to tighten an interval?
-- this makes the most sense to me - would need the default timepoints


DELIVERY:
Ok lets figure out this whole thing...
- If Gridiron determines that third party analysis of the Biomass is required for processing
- sub_event: third party analysis is required for processing
- or make it more active: Biomass requires third party analysis 
-- requiring_agent:
-- requiring_object:...
-- may check framenet for requires...

- event: Gridiron determines that X
-- X must be a predicate form?
-- subject: Gridiron 
-- verb: determines (meta)
-- event: 

- the main event would require a property of the sub_event 
- frame: would be fine 
- sym_updater: we add the event as we back-process...
- then we need to *reference* the event when we get to the relative clause verb
- honestly I think its doable... let's get feedback though



The point of delivery of the Product Samples shall be a laboratory determined by Gridiron, if Gridiron determines that third party analysis of the Biomass is required for processing
- setting a domain property - would perhaps require a new event and re-declaration
- There is a condition - if Gridiron determines that third party analysis of the Biomass is required for processing
- its a bit unclear. What is the point of delivery otherwise?
- how to turn this into symboleo...
-- IF X happens, then set the delivery location... But we cant mutate...

Shi Farms shall be responsible to ship the Product Samples to the designated laboratory
- related the one above. May need to relate them 
- is shipping the same as delivery?


Shi Farms shall be responsible for delivery of the Biomass to the processor determined by Gridiron, in good form as described above "A. Product".
- is the processor different than the laboratory?
- we also have a reference to another part of the contract 


TERMINATION
Either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to delivery of the Product
- How do we characterize this "prior to"? its result is ambiguous... interesting example of ambiguity 
- Have an initial power; then on product delivery, we trigger the suspension of these...?
- could be framed as until...

If any claim or legal proceeding is filed by a third party, prompt notice is required by the one to the other
- would "third party" be captured as a role?
- "one to the other"; again, who does this refer to?

When the Agreement ends, each party shall return all copies of any such information to the other and take every reasonable measure to preclude its representatives from sharing or keeping such information
- would this be considered a surviving obligation. If so, do we need the trigger? 
- another coreference (such)
