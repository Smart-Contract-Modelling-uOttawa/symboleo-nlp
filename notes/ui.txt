Goal
- Create a Web UI to demo the tool
- Likely will not need things like DB or API, etc
- Likely wont be allowing NEW contracts. Just work with the ones we have
- mainly just want a nicer demo interface

Flow
- show the NL template - have the option to view the Symboleo
- Choose a parameter to refine. 
- Select input tokens - static/dybnamic/etc
- Run updates - show the updated contract and Symboleo
