CURRENT STATUS
- can get through the full sample contract refinements (aligned with the thesis)

TODOS
- Verify for frame completion before submit button is allowed. Ensure we have a valid frame, and that we've reached a final node 
- Figure out what to do with the final node. May be useful, but dont want to present it
- Punctuation/Capitalization (pattern nl updater)
- Remove parameter after they have been filled (deeper symboleo)
- have a "clear" button to restart the flow
- host it


Deployment
- will need to clean out the requirements
- will also need to load an nlp module (unless we want to use the fake one)
- can build the nlp locally, put it in the file, un-ignore it, so its loaded
- then can remove the requirements needed to build it...
- currently looking in to pythonanywhere...
