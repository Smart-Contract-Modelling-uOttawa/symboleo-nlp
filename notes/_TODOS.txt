May 22-28:
- Go through RQ3 samples - organize them. Make a few sample ones in a test suite 
- Set up the rest of the samples - try to get at least 25. Eventually maybe get to 50
- Try out some specific metrics 

May 29-Jun 4:
- New and final sample contract
- clean out all the sample contracts 
- organize test suites (especially the ob fulfilled/violated stuff)


NL TODOS
- General
-- obligation fulfilled and violated events
-- Capitalization and punctuation
-- figure out "providing X days notice" event

- Sample
-- need to work in the 'unless such delay exceeds 10 days' to the template...

- Rental
-- until landlord allows pets should be "unless" - would want to make it written notice as well...
-- termination notice event - figure it out

SYM TODOS
- General
-- parameters and dates 

- Sample

- Rental



NL TODOS
- domain timepoints should turn into cleaner-looking parameters, e.g. [del_due_date]
- fulfilled and violated obligations should make use of their event (consequent) 
-- this will require lots of work, including a Declaration -> CustomEvent mapper
- fix the event to_text - getting some strange results on the rental one
- after an if, might add a comma, and also lower-case the next word
- replace "until" with "unless"
- fix the days in advance on the standard event... - likely a tough one
- rental: pow_termination_abandon - just way off...?
- prop: legal proceedings [ON THE PROPERTY??]
- grid: if buyer determinee necessary ...
- 


GOALS FOR MAY
- New contract template 
- SYMBOLEO: re-add parm and parm config; handle multiple norms in one request; More convenience methods; more tests on the spec
- NLP: Improve extractors (add contract), Better use of spacy and framenet, Have a separate NLP test suite (spacy, MLConjug, Framenet)
- Metrics Standardization: Have a process that runs the test suites and gives some more detailed metric-related information
- Clean code: Do some renaming (AbstractNode = Token, etc.); clean out older code; unit tests up to 70%


JUNE
- Final contract template
- Make a web ui
- Unit tests at 80%

JULY
- Review all templates
- Unit tests at 90%
- autocomplete/suggestion functionality and string -> nodes

AUGUST
- Unit tests at full coverage


MAJOR TODOS:
- More handling on the trigger/consequent... Might require re-introducing parameters and parmConfig; trigger should add to start of NL for example.. 
- NounPhrase: More work on noun phrase extractor; interfaces for the nlp functionality...
- PrepPhrase: More work on the extractor. Lots of NLP functionality 
- Handling the cases where we reference TWO norms (e.g. "either buyer or seller"...)
- obligation-related events - would be better to use the event rather than ob_payment obligaton is violated (for example) - tough one...
- Powers: Do we want to allow user to add ANY power - could be constructed... may be too much
- NL issues: How will we handle coreferences?


OTHER TODOS:
- CustomEvent: more options/parms for custom_events to_text()
- CustomEvent: Make the is_complete() function more complex
- NounPhrase: Add more types and complexity to the to_text() 
- Verb: Negation flag on the verb
- General: Remove OpCode from Frame ?
- Grammar: Replace the Until with Unless
- UpdatePackage: alias/type the update package new_value..
- Contract Spec: Get rid of the awkward sorting functionality. Will require new eq func on SymboleoContract
- StandardEvent: Finish adding all the contract components
- NLP: Make a Fake NLP once I have everything figured out. Or more sophisticated interfaces
- ParmOpCode: Do we still need ADD_DM_PROP... I dont think so
