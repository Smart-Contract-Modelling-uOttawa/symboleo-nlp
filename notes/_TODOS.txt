Next todos:
- May 1-7: Focus on Symboleo: parm and parm config, handling multiple norms in one request... Also a new contract template
- May 8-14: NLP work: improve extractors (add contract), make wider use of spacy and framenet - write a lot of NLP-specific tests
- May 15-21: Metrics standardization in the code
- May 22-28: Web UI 

TODOS this weekend
- Review the symboleo diffs; make a todo list
- NL FIXES:
- fix the X days in advance issue
- clean the domain timepoint parameters
- better variables
- replace until with unless
- look at event to_text - try to get slight improvement at least
- add comma after an if..
- basically everything except for the obligation fulfilled. Thats the big one
- OTHERS:


NL TODOS
- domain timepoints should turn into cleaner-looking parameters, e.g. [del_due_date]
- fulfilled and violated obligations should make use of their event (consequent) 
-- this will require lots of work, including a Declaration -> CustomEvent mapper
- fix the event to_text - getting some strange results on the rental one
- after an if, might add a comma, and also lower-case the next word
- replace "until" with "unless"
- fix the days in advance on the standard event... - likely a tough one
- rental: pow_termination_abandon - just way off...?
- why 3 days in advance...? popping up all over the prop contract.Some static variable issue maybe
- prop: legal proceedings [ON THE PROPERTY??]
- prop: replace 10 with variable...
- grid: if buyer determinee necessary ...
- 


GOALS FOR MAY
- New contract template 
- SYMBOLEO: re-add parm and parm config; handle multiple norms in one request; More convenience methods; more tests on the spec
- NLP: Improve extractors (add contract), Better use of spacy and framenet, Have a separate NLP test suite (spacy, MLConjug, Framenet)
- Metrics Standardization: Have a process that runs the test suites and gives some more detailed metric-related information
- Clean code: Do some renaming (AbstractNode = Token, etc.); clean out older code; unit tests up to 70%


JUNE
- Final contract template
- Make a web ui
- Unit tests at 80%

JULY
- Review all templates
- Unit tests at 90%
- autocomplete/suggestion functionality and string -> nodes

AUGUST
- Unit tests at full coverage


MAJOR TODOS:
- More handling on the trigger/consequent... Might require re-introducing parameters and parmConfig; trigger should add to start of NL for example.. 
- NounPhrase: More work on noun phrase extractor; interfaces for the nlp functionality...
- PrepPhrase: More work on the extractor. Lots of NLP functionality 
- Handling the cases where we reference TWO norms (e.g. "either buyer or seller"...)
- obligation-related events - would be better to use the event rather than ob_payment obligaton is violated (for example) - tough one...
- Powers: Do we want to allow user to add ANY power - could be constructed... may be too much
- NL issues: How will we handle coreferences?


OTHER TODOS:
- CustomEvent: more options/parms for custom_events to_text()
- CustomEvent: Make the is_complete() function more complex
- NounPhrase: Add more types and complexity to the to_text() 
- Verb: Negation flag on the verb
- General: Remove OpCode from Frame
- Grammar: Replace the Until with Unless
- UpdatePackage: alias/type the update package new_value..
- Contract Spec: Get rid of the awkward sorting functionality. Will require new eq func on SymboleoContract
- StandardEvent: Finish adding all the contract components
- NLP: Make a Fake NLP once I have everything figured out. Or more sophisticated interfaces
- ParmOpCode: Do we still need ADD_DM_PROP... I dont think so
