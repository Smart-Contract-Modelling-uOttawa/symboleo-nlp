done
- finished the rental contract
- organized the process around a sequence of operations - much more testable
- split out the NLP stuff
- Separated out the user scripts for the various operations

Next todos (April):
- Make the contract updates into methods on the SymboleoContract object 
- Ensure the NL aligns properly - verb tenses, etc.
- Make sure that the customizations are updating the nl_parameters
- Get tests up to 95% coverage 
- some initial validation on the verb entry 
- clean up demo, better messages, etc.
- Framenet: Should stress-test this a bit more. Might make a wrapper and a bunch of tests around it
- option to simply declare a new event (easy - already handling it - just make it an operation)
- New contract... 
- Try the frames for adding props again - maybe go for generic properties (e.g. with PROP QUALITY)
- clean out old code and organize folders 

May: 
- Another contract - full-stack test 
- tests up to 98%
- Maybe start web UI 
- wrap up any other NLP 
- start with user string and convert to node list

Jun
- Last contract
- Make a web ui
- work on autocomplete

** Im thinking that it would make more sense for the contract operations to be class methods...
- would keep things a bit more organized, and honestly makes more sense 
- they are straightforward mutations...
- add_domain_obj, add_norm, update_norm, add_decl... all very doable. That's what I should do...
-- This can be a job for April. So dont worry about those operation tests for now. They'll be moved
- Would need to move the spec into a folder so that it is properly tested. Need to do this with some other thigns as well...

MAJOR TODOS:
- General: Figure out the CommonEvents and templates
- More handling on the trigger/consequent... Might require re-introducing parameters and parmConfig; trigger should add to start of NL for example.. 
- Input: Add options to the AbstractNode where needed
- NounPhrase: More work on noun phrase extractor; interfaces for the nlp functionality...
- PrepPhrase: More work on the extractor. Lots of NLP functionality 
- Input: Figure out mechanism for getting children after selecting a node - will be complex. Will also include StandardEvent
- CustomEvent: Intransitive EventDeclarationMapper
- Powers: Do we want to allow user to add ANY power - could be constructed... may be too much
- NL issues: How will we handle coreferences?


TODOS:
- CustomEvent: more options/parms for custom_events to_text()
- CustomEvent: Make the is_complete() function more complex
- NounPhrase: Add more types and complexity to the to_text() 
- Verb: Negation flag on the verb
- General: Remove OpCode from Frame
- Grammar: Replace the Until with Unless
- UpdatePackage: alias/type the update package new_value..
- Contract Spec: Get rid of the awkward sorting functionality. Will require new eq func on SymboleoContract
- StandardEvent: Finish adding all the contract components
- NLP: Make a Fake NLP once I have everything figured out. Or more sophisticated interfaces
- ParmOpCode: Do we still need ADD_DM_PROP... I dont think so
