====================
======= TODOS ======
====================

TOP PRIORITY
- Update the contract NL 
- Start making tests and concrete requiresment/metrics for input selection
- Add CustomEvent template to all needed declarations 
- Smooth out the capitalization and punctuation 
- Figure out the parm customization - will we control the allowed customizations based on the parm?
- Re-add Parameter updates on contract update - and integrate into tests

IMPORTANT
- Clean up the Symboleo contract code 
- May change the event declaration to include objects (e.g. OccupyProperty instead of Occupy)
- Break up the Asset and declaration mappers
- Rework in common events 
- Look into adding date as an event property; so it can be referenced again 
- Figure out if we need more detailed parm config 
- More Isolated Tests. Aim for 25 in total. Cover all patterns 

MAYBE
- Attempt to represent the "provide X days of notice" termination power
