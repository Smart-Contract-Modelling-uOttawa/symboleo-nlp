PLAN:
- Jul 24 - 30: link norm component, add parms, difficult CNL elements, engg work (break up funcs), 75% test coverage 
- Jul 31 - Aug 6: Any other required todos; 85% test coverage, 
- Aug 7 - 13: full tests
- Aug 14 - 20: Deployment and hosting; documentation, cleanup, next steps 


FEATURES
- Decide on the "difficult" CNL elements: AfterEvent, NoticeEvent, EventInterval
- Finish up Custom Events and Norm Events (all verbs and nouns)
- is_complete: event and pattern class
- Do we need to link the norm component in the config?
- Adding needed Parameters
- Add DATE for BeforeDate as event property?
- Figure out mapping verb types (trans, intrans, link). also is linking different?
- Common events? Probably not, but may specify as future work in thesis
- Do we need Domain Timepoints and DomainTimepointExtractor?
- Attempt to represent the "provide X days of notice" termination power ?

BUGS
- The parameters disappear from norm_events if theyve been populated

ENGG - need to break these up
- Asset Declarations
- Declaration prop mapper
- Pattern Extractor (reverse tree building)


TESTS
- Maximize unit test coverage
- isolated tests: Find one example for each pattern from the real contract. Will alter the events. Should pass
- full tests: Just to show full suite. Will highlight missing pieces
- Beef up NLP test coverage


Deployment
- will need to clean out the requirements
- will also need to load an nlp module (unless we want to use the fake one)
- can build the nlp locally, put it in the file, un-ignore it, so its loaded
- then can remove the requirements needed to build it...
- currently looking in to pythonanywhere...
