PRIORITIES
- Integrate the full CNL. Identify any weak spots or issues
- Identify all the tests and test suites we want. Run coverage (this weekend?
- Answer the key feature questions (related to thesis) and update accordingly
- Clean out old code
- Break out complex linguistic function
- Identify all spots for NLP. Run some simple tests with them
- Hosting?


Plan
- Jul 3-9: Clean up unit testing and coverage. Clean out old code 
- Jul 10-16: Add the full CNL; update the tree structure; Integrate feature updates from thesis 
- Jul 17-23: more unit tests - mostly a thesis week
- Jul 24-30: Handle all the features and engg. No more todos 
- Jul 31 - Aug 6: Hosting/env/deployment, tests  
- Aug 7 - 13: Finish up testing



FEATURE
- Full CNL, handlers, integration tests
- Finish up Custom Events and Norm Events (all verbs and nouns)
- is_complete: event and pattern class
- Do we need to link the norm component in the config?
- Adding needed Parameters
- Add DATE for BeforeDate as event property?
- Figure out mapping verb types (trans, intrans, link). also is linking different?
- Common events? Probably not, but may specify as future work in thesis
- Do we need Domain Timepoints and DomainTimepointExtractor?
- Attempt to represent the "provide X days of notice" termination power ?


ENGG
- figure out role of FinalElement/FinalNode
- instead of children, reference a common EBNF-type grammar
- Asset Declarations
- Declaration prop mapper


BUGS

UI
- host it?

CLEANUP
- Elements
- EventNLTemplate
- Old


TESTS
- integration tests: custom event to text, pattern class to text
- full unit test coverage
- special nlp coverage
- The full-stack tests? Still relevant? If so, then need updating. Will want to give them another sweep

Deployment
- will need to clean out the requirements
- will also need to load an nlp module (unless we want to use the fake one)
- can build the nlp locally, put it in the file, un-ignore it, so its loaded
- then can remove the requirements needed to build it...
- currently looking in to pythonanywhere...
