The NLP requirements are becoming very clear now
- execution of it will be harder

sample use case 
- if the renter abandons the property...
- the event of abandoning the property does not yet exist

- so they add a trigger 
- then they select a custom event
- then they enter the following:
-- verb: occupy
--- looks it up on framenet, finds the frame elements: resident and location 
-- these are filled by the user 
-- Then it creates the event 

Idea: lets not allow custom events 
- The user must first CREATE an event in the domain;
- and THEN, they can use it in obligations...
- Keeps it a little bit cleaner 

Therefore we need a new operation: Creating a domain event 
- everything else is the same process - e.g. w.r.t framenet
